Overview of the study
=========================

Participant Recruitment
------------------------
N=250 young adults (18-29) with personal Android smartphone who engage in recommended levels of physical activity (PA) or intend to within the next 12 months.

Study design
------------
Up to 12 months of data collection

- Online questionnaires at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months into the study

- Continuous smartwatch wear (~23 hours/day every day including during sleep)

- Signal Contingent EMA questions on smartphone and smartwatch

  - Phone End of day EMA survey (1-2 min) -> every night delivered 3 hours before self-reported sleep time

  - Phone Burst survey (1-2 min) -> 4-day smartphone survey bursts twice a month at least 7 days apart. Each burst period consists of 2 weekends and 2 weekdays. Survey is delivered once an hour during participant’s self-reported waking hours.

  - Phone Wake/Sleep survey (1 min)-> every 6-8 hours to confirm or establish previous/next sleep/wake time

  - Smartwatch survey (2-4 seconds) -> single questions that mirror EMA measures, validate sensor measurements, or test data validity. Up to 6 an hour during self-reported waking hours.

- Context-Sensitive EMA (contingent on events/exposures detected by built-in smartphone/smartwatch sensors) to improve utility of sensor data

  - Location, social context, posture/ambulation, watch wear/non-wear, sleep duration
