Overview of the study
=========================
The **Temporal Influences on Movement and Exercise (TIME) Study** uses mobile and wearable technologies to measure moment-to-moment experiences that shape our health behaviors and decision making. The goal is to study how different contextual and situational factors explain the adoption and maintenance of health behaviors. We are using a combination of phone-based experience sampling, wearable-based micro-EMA, and passive sensing to build predictive models of health behavior at the individual and group levels. We conducted a within-subject case-crossover observational study across a 12-month period among ethnically-diverse, emerging adults (ages 18-29). .

Participant Recruitment
------------------------
N=250 young adults (18-29) with personal Android smartphone who engage in recommended levels of physical activity (PA) or intend to within the next 12 months.

Study design
------------
Up to 12 months of data collection

- Online questionnaires at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months into the study

- Continuous smartwatch wear (~23 hours/day every day including during sleep)

- Signal Contingent EMA questions on smartphone and smartwatch

  - Phone End of day EMA survey (1-2 min) -> every night delivered 3 hours before self-reported sleep time

  - Phone Burst survey (1-2 min) -> 4-day smartphone survey bursts twice a month at least 7 days apart. Each burst period consists of 2 weekends and 2 weekdays. Survey is delivered once an hour during participant’s self-reported waking hours.

  - Phone Wake/Sleep survey (1 min)-> every 6-8 hours to confirm or establish previous/next sleep/wake time

  - Smartwatch survey (2-4 seconds) -> single questions that mirror EMA measures, validate sensor measurements, or test data validity. Up to 6 an hour during self-reported waking hours.

- Context-Sensitive EMA (contingent on events/exposures detected by built-in smartphone/smartwatch sensors) to improve utility of sensor data

  - Location, social context, posture/ambulation, watch wear/non-wear, sleep duration
